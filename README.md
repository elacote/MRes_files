# This repository is for my MRes project in Bioinformatics and systems biology
#"Interferon-gamma, a potential key player in the transcriptomic signature of autism "
#I wanted to compare the modifications of gene expression and transcript usage induced by interferon-gamma treatment in iPSC-derived neuronal cells and those observed in ASD neuronal cells.

#These are the scripts I have used for this project, as well as some files that are called in the script, and some results.
