# This repository is for my MRes project in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology: "Interferon-gamma, a potential key player in the transcriptomic signature of autism "

I wanted to compare the modifications of gene expression and transcript usage induced by interferon-gamma treatment in iPSC-derived neuronal cells and those observed in ASD neuronal cells. Indeed, the cytokine is known to be linked with autism pathophysiology, and we expect to identify convergent pathways and better understand how interferon-gamma could explain some aspects of the diverse autistic phenotypes.

These are the scripts I have used for this project, as well as some files that are called in the script, and some results.
